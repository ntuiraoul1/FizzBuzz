**FIZZBUZZ EXERCISE IN DART**

The program uses a for loop to iterate through numbers from 1 to 100 (inclusive).
 Inside the loop:
 We check if the current number (num) is divisible by both 3 and 5 (using the modulo operator %). 
 If so, it's a FizzBuzz case, and we print "FizzBuzz". If not divisible by both, we check divisibility by 3 only. 
 If true, it's a Fizz case, and we print "Fizz". Then, we check divisibility by 5 only. 
 If true, it's a Buzz case, and we print "Buzz".
 If none of the above conditions are met, it's a regular number, so we simply print the number itself.
 This program achieves the FizzBuzz logic using a series of if and else if statements to handle the different conditions.
